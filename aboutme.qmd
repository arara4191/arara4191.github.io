Aside from learning about the outdoors in my studies, I love to spend time outside exploring with my pets, whether its going on walks. Recently, I've gotten more involved in gardening at the UCSB Wetland space managed by the American Indian and Indigenous Students Center. Although we cannot consume plants in this space due to the historic contamination by the university, it's been a great experience to tend to the vegetation in this area and be in community with my friends. Here are some pictures of my pets, gardening, and side crafts!
