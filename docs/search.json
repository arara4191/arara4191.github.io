    "text": "Welcome\nWelcome to my website! My name is Arantza Lira and its my pleasure to introduce myself to you! Currently I’m a junior at UC Santa Barbara studying for my Bachelors of Science in Environmental Studies. Although I’ve spent the last three years near the beach, I grew up in the desert in a border town in Southern California called Calexico. Although I cherish my hometown, the environmental health issues from unsustainable agricultural practices and climate impacts back home inspired me to pursue a degree in Environmental Studies focusing on food accessibility, agricultural systems and environmental data science. As you learn more about my journey feel free to navigate to the tabs on this page to learn more about me,my projects, my resume and hobbies."

    "text": "Aside from learning about the outdoors in my studies, I love to spend time outside exploring with my pets, whether its going on walks. Recently, I’ve gotten more involved in gardening at the UCSB Wetland space managed by the American Indian and Indigenous Students Center. Although we cannot consume plants in this space due to the historic contamination by the university, it’s been a great experience to tend to the vegetation in this area and be in community with my friends. Here are some pictures of my pets, gardening, and side crafts!\n\nPets\nMeet Bruno and Pantera! (left to right)\n\n\n\nThey mainly coexist inside the house but they love exploring the backyard together\n\n\n\n\nGardening\nShout out to the wetland garden space\n  \n\n\nCrafting\nThis quarter I was part of the ENV S 194TK class where we learned about and practices traditional ecological knowledge with the guidance of a wonderful native student teaching team. Part of our class project was to create something with our plant relative, mine of which was Cattails. Here the stuffed animal I made from Cattails!\n\n\n\nThey are also made using materials from a second hand craft store\n\n\n\n\n\nCattail fluff"
